//! Topology: how a mesh's points, edges and faces connect, as an index
//! built from the mesh.
//!
//! The mesh itself stores only points and faces (as corner lists), which
//! can describe anything, including the awkward cases: n-gons, open
//! borders, edges shared by three or more faces, loose points. This index
//! answers the questions selection and modelling tools ask: which faces
//! use an edge, which edges meet at a point, which faces are neighbours,
//! and how edge loops and rings run. It never changes the mesh. It
//! depends only on the faces, so the mesh keeps it with them
//! ([`Mesh::topology`]): moving points doesn't need it worked out again.
//!
//! Edges are named by their two points ([`EdgeKey`]), so an edge's name
//! is as stable as its points' ids.
