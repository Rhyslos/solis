//! Primitives: plain ready-made shapes (cube, plane, cylinder, sphere,
//! disc, tube and cone), each built from a few settings such as size and
//! number of segments. The brushes' shapes ([`crate::shapes`]) are built
//! on them.
//!
//! Every primitive stands on the ground with its pivot at the bottom
//! centre (the plane and disc lie flat on it), so it is placed by its
//! base. Sizes are in the mesh's own units. Settings are kept
//! within sensible limits (see [`MIN_SIZE`] and friends) so a typo can't
//! make a shape too small to see or too big to build.
//!
//! Building the same settings always gives the same mesh, ids included.
